Hello!

This project was created for a client as a multitouch / scale rotate informational table.
This version is stripped down of all logos and brand specfic graphics and tracking, and I thought it would be useful as a springboard for touch tables. 

Tested with 007 on codeblocks::windows , and xcode on mac.

The TUIO events didn't seem to dispatch ofxMultiTouch events correct on Windows, so I changed the events to use ofxPixelHitTest instead.

Also on new intel systems the hyper-threading ( or something else only on new Intel Chips ) seems to destroy std::vector, AMD has been fine though.
