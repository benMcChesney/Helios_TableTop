Hello!

This project was created for a client as a multitouch / scale rotate informational table.
This version is stripped down of all logos and brand specfic graphics and tracking.

Tested with 007 on codeblocks::windows , and xcode on mac.

The TUIO events don't seem to fire correctly on windows, so there is a mangabled hit/test mess.

Also on new intel systems the hyper-threading ( or something else only on new Intel Chips ) seems to destroy std::vector, AMD has been fine though.
